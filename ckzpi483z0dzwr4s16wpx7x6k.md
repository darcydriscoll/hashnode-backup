## üçî 3 Takeaways From My Internship @ Xero

Hi, I'm Darcy.

Think fast! Here's a picture of my face with my favourite GeoCities gifs:

For the past four months, I interned as a software engineer over at [Xero](https://www.xero.com). It's a company that makes accounting software for small businesses.

Right out of the gate:

I started antidepressants a week before the first interview.

Whoopsie-daisy! Sitting there and performing the words of a functioning human being while my brain re-wired itself was [quite brutal](https://www.organicauthority.com/energetic-health/what-my-first-week-on-antidepressant-drugs-was-really-like). Even after I got the offer (yay!) and the first weeks of SSRI torment passed (thank god!), I still had plenty of anxiety about the program.

Endless questions:

‚ú® What if I hate the work?

üí´ How will I talk to people twice as old as me with real industry experience?

üåü Will I get exploited? Will I cope under capitalism?

üå† Am I simply not cut out, not strong enough, too 'dumb' for this kind of job?

You know. Fun stuff.

Maybe you've had similar thoughts before. Maybe you're applying for internships and grad programs yourself. Or maybe you're gearing up for one?

Whatever the case, I wanted to share my takeaways from the program with you.

I'll also be comparing each takeaway to a [real takeaway food](https://order.hungryjacks.com.au/) I ate whilst working from home.

Obviously. *Duh.*

*(Psst: my opinions don't represent the opinions of Xero. Just FYI.)*

# üêó Software engineers are people too

I don't know about you, but people in software have always intimidated me.

I'm talking about the people who have grand LinkedIn headlines, who run developer blogs about obscure tech I don't understand, and who contribute to open-source Git repos like they're breathing. The people who have 'made it'. The people who 'know what they're doing'.

You know, that one question:

> ‚ú® How the hell am I meant to stack up to these people?

What I realised through my internship is that I ask very silly and wrong questions.

As I got comfortable in my team at Xero, I found, miraculously, that my teammates were all people. People I could approach and listen to. Real people with kids and problems and hobbies. Who had also been working for 10-20 years and were way better than me at everything.

Huh.

And so I internalised one of those things that's blatantly obvious but hard to swallow. People are vulnerable creatures working on themselves. People are better than you at a lot of things. But the brands people build online are only reflections of how much capital they want from employers or from people like you.*

And also that my imposter syndrome is ego. [David Foster Wallace who?](https://medium.com/cosy/the-philosophy-of-arrogance-cd9ff43310b5)

*Watch out!*

If I were to compare this takeaway to a real takeaway food, I'd compare it to a McDonald's Big Mac! You see, they're big and intimidating in the ads, but when you get your hands on one it's only like slightly larger than a regular burger and is actually just as tasty.

For my next takeaway...

# üè≠ Problem solving is mindfulness

Okay, some context:

CI/CD pipelines are shared conveyor belts that [automate the deployment of releases](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/ci-cd-guide/). You can trigger builds on pull requests, inspect deployments if they fail tests, and even configure your team's pipeline in code for better maintainability and repudiation.

Basically: they're the closest software engineering gets to [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). Or if your pipeline sucks, that one [I Love Lucy scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkQ58I53mjk).

At Xero, I migrated an old software component onto a shiny new [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) pipeline. This was my first time working with legacy code, let alone legacy code that I needed to refactor!

It was a struggle. I burnt myself out and hyperfocused on little issues that weren't important.

Configuring the pipeline with [TeamCity's Kotlin DSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/kotlin-dsl.html) didn't help things. The DSL wasn't in regular use at the company, has [barebones documentation](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/dsl-documentation/jetbrains.build-server.configs.kotlin.v2019_2/index.html), and doesn't integrate well with newer JDK versions when generating configs locally (use JDK 16!).

I learned from my buddy/mentor that problem solving is often about being mindful. If I'm spending hours on a small issue, it's time to ignore my ego and take a step back. Re-investigate the problem. Break it into little pieces. And if I still can't fix it, ask for help; rarely am I engineering in a vacuum.

By adopting this mindful approach to problem solving, the work became more efficient and way, way more fun.

But I've still got a long way to go. The tough part for me is making it a habit. There's a sick, familiar pleasure in [doing the same thing and expecting different results...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjmKlYjUak)

Speaking of sick and familiar pleasures, if I were to compare this takeaway to a real fast food I would obviously compare it to a Supreme Leader Supreme Burger Feed combo! It's dependable, it's fulfilling, and *goddamn*, that chicken is something to savour.

Onwards to our final takeaway!

# üßò Wellbeing is good actually

I used to think that wellbeing was a complete sham.

I thought that it didn't help people with 'real' issues. That it's encouraged by corporations to [distract from poor working conditions](https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/workplace-corporate-wellness-policies-mental-health/100530424).

But I interned at Xero. And I had welcoming coworkers. I had flexible work policies, and a culture that resisted burn-out.

But I was still anxious doing my job every day.

So what gives?

Turns out, my concerns about wellbeing were reasonable in certain contexts. But not in mine. Xero was a great place to work. I was using these 'concerns' as a crutch to avoid self-improvement. (We meet again, ego.)

To upskill and thrive, I needed to treat myself like a person with value.

So I started meditating, forcing myself to take breaks, and sleeping better. I continued with my GP-prescribed mental health care plan and [discovered the ways I build toxic narratives about myself](https://www.youtube.com/c/HealthyGamerGG).

And in the end, all this stuff I passed off? It's great, truly effective, backed by science.

Wellbeing's not a cure-all pill or anything, but it certainly helps. And I'm a more professional engineer because of it.

And so, *drumroll...*

If I were to compare this final takeaway to a real takeaway food...

I'd probably compare it to the feeling of eating a piece of fruit after exclusively eating fast food for two weeks in lockdown!

In the moment you feel lame. But in the long-term you feel less like human garbage.

# All good things must come to an end

Thanks for reading my three takeaways. Let me know if you got something out of them. And if you want to chat about your own experience dipping your toes into the industry, please get in touch.

Thanks also to Xero for having me for their internship program!

If it wasn't obvious already, Xero treated me great and I loved working there. Sincerely. If you're hunting for internships and are near an office [I highly recommend it](https://www.xero.com/au/about/graduate/internships/).

Also, this is my first blog post. Got any feedback? I welcome it.
